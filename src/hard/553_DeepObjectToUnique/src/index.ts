   553 - Deep object to unique
  -------
  by null (@uid11) #hard #deep
  
  ### Question
  
  TypeScript has structural type system, but sometimes you want a function to accept only some previously well-defined unique objects (as in the nominal type system), and not any objects that have the required fields.
  
  Create a type that takes an object and makes it and all deeply nested objects in it unique, while preserving the string and numeric keys of all objects, and the values of all properties on these keys.
  
  The original type and the resulting unique type must be mutually assignable, but not identical. 
  
  For example,
  
  ```ts
  import { Equal } from "@type-challenges/utils"
  
  type Foo = { foo: 2; bar: { 0: 1 }; baz: { 0: 1 } }
  
  type UniqFoo = DeepObjectToUniq<Foo>
  
  declare let foo: Foo
  declare let uniqFoo: UniqFoo
  
  uniqFoo = foo // ok
  foo = uniqFoo // ok
  
  type T0 = Equal<UniqFoo, Foo> // false
  type T1 = UniqFoo["foo"] // 2
  type T2 = Equal<UniqFoo["bar"], UniqFoo["baz"]> // false
  type T3 = UniqFoo["bar"][0] // 1
  type T4 = Equal<keyof Foo & string, keyof UniqFoo & string> // true
  ```
